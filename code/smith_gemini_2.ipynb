The relevant part of the statute defines \"use\" implicitly by connecting it to crimes of violence or drug trafficking: \"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime... uses or carries a firearm...\"  The statute doesn't specifically define \"use,\" but it implies a connection to the underlying crime.\n",
       "\n",

       "    1. Possessed the MAC-10 (brought it from Tennessee to Florida).\n",
       "    2. Showed the MAC-10 to the undercover officer.\n",

He was trying to trade it directly for cocaine, demonstrating it was integral to his drug trafficking operation.  He wasn’t just *carrying* the gun, he actively involved it in a proposed drug transaction.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Influencing aspects of the case:  The fact that Mr. Smith traveled across state lines suggests a more serious and planned criminal enterprise. His modification of the weapon to be fully automatic also suggests he intended it to be a dangerous tool. He actively sought a drug trade specifically *using* the gun as barter.  The summary explicitly says the MAC-10 was a favorite of criminals and could be “devastating.”\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Arguments:\n",
       "    For \"use\": Mr. Smith took the gun out and displayed it as the central part of a drug deal negotiation. He was essentially trying to purchase cocaine with the gun itself, not with money.  It wasn’t passively in his possession; it was actively being bartered. \n",
       "\n",
       "    Against \"use\":  He didn't fire the weapon, nor did he explicitly threaten anyone with it.  One could argue he was simply *carrying* it and happened to mention it during the drug discussion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Opinion:  A reasonable person would likely conclude Mr. Smith \"used\" the gun within the meaning of the statute. While he didn't fire it, his presentation of the weapon, his proposed barter of it for cocaine, and the context of the overall drug trafficking operation strongly link the gun to the criminal activity.  The gun wasn’t incidental; it was a key component in his attempted drug deal.\n",

       "REASONING: Mr. Smith didn’t just have the gun with him; he took it out and offered it as direct payment for drugs.  He was using the gun as a tool to further his drug dealing.  This seems like \"use\" given he was actively trying to trade the gun itself for drugs as a key part of a drug trafficking crime.\n"
