       "First, he brought the gun with him to a drug deal. That's not something you do by accident. Then, he actually took it out and showed it to someone he thought was a pawnshop dealer. He even offered to trade the gun for drugs. \n",
       "\n",
       "To me, all of this counts as 'using' the gun. He's not just carrying it around for protection or because he forgot it was in his bag. He's actively bringing it out, showing it off, and trying to use it as a bargaining chip in a drug deal. \n",
       "\n",
       "The statute talks about using a gun \"during and in relation to\" a drug crime. Well, trying to trade a gun for cocaine sure seems like it's related to drug trafficking to me. He's literally offering the gun as payment for drugs.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think most people would agree that if you're waving a gun around during a drug deal and offering to trade it, you're 'using' that gun, even if you never fire it. It's being used as a tool in the crime, just like you might 'use' a car to drive to a robbery, even if you don't hit anyone with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "So yeah, as an average person, I'd definitely say Mr. Smith 'used' his gun here in the way the law seems to mean."
