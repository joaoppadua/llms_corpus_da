That seems like actively using the gun to me, even if he didn't shoot it. The gun was a key part of the drug deal he was trying to make. In everyday language, if you're offering something in a trade, you're 'using' it as part of that deal. It's like if someone tried to use a fake ID to buy alcohol - they're 'using' the ID even if they don't succeed in getting the drinks. So yeah, I'd say Smith was 'using' the gun in this crime.\n"
